/**
 * The class that represents a simple hash table that maps keys to values. Any
 * non-null object can be used as a key, while any object whatsoever can be used
 * as value (even null). This class provides user with two public constructors:
 * the default one that creates a 16 slot table and another one in case user
 * wants to specify number of slots himself. However, specified capacity can
 * only be a power of two. If this is not true, the capacity will be normalized
 * to the first power of number two bigger than the entered initial capacity. If
 * initial capacity is less than one, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
 * This hashtable uses overlay policy and as such provides user with the
 * possiblity of storing more elements than the number of slots. This
 * implementation provides user with standard methods for working with
 * hashtables, such as get, put, clear, size, containsKey, containsValue, etc.
 * Since the efficiency of any hashtable deteriorates rapidly once the number of
 * stored elements reaches approximately 75% of number of slots, a doubling
 * capacity policy is in use. Load factor of 0.75 is used since it makes for a
 * good tradeoff between time and space costs.
 *
 * @param <K>
 *            the type of the key
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the value
