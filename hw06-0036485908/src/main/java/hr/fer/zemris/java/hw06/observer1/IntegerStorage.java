 * The Class which is responsible for storing the observed number. This class is

 * called the Subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called Observers, and
 * notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of
 * their methods, method valueChanged in this case. This class implements
 * IntegerStorageObserver interface which prescribes the designated contract for
 * communication between Subject (this class) and its Concrete observers. This
 * class provides user with methods for registering and deregistering Concrete
 * observers and for altering the stored value. Whenever the stored value is
 * changed, this class notifies all currently registered observers.
